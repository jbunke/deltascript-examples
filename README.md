This repository houses example scripts written in [_DeltaScript_](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time/wiki/DeltaScript), an original scripting language designed for use in [Delta Time](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time) applications. The scripts in this repository do not make use of the language's extension features.

The file extension `.ds` is merely a convention; scripts can be run with any file extension or none at all.
